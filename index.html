<h2>
  <div id="app">
    {{ message }}
  </div>
</h2>

We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a string template, but Vue has
done a lot of work under the hood. <strong>The data and the DOM are now linked</strong>, and everything is now
<strong>reactive</strong>.

<script>
  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  })
</script>

<p>
  How do we know?
<ul>
  <li>Open your browser’s JavaScript console (right now, on this page) and </li>
  <li> set <code>app.message</code> to a
    different value. </li>
</ul>

You should see the rendered example above update accordingly.
</p>


<h2>No interpolation occurs outside the Vue app entry point</h2>


<h3>{{ message }}</h3>

<h2>The v-bind directive</h2>

He re we define a second entry point for a second Vue app object:

<div id="app-2">
  <span v-bind:title="message">
    <strong>
      Hover your mouse over me for a few seconds
      to see my dynamically bound title!
    </strong>
  </span>
</div>


<script>
  var app2 = new Vue({
    el: '#app-2',
    data: {
      message: 'You loaded this page on ' + new Date().toLocaleString()
    }
  })
</script>

<p>
  Here we are encountering something new. The <code>v-bind</code> attribute you are seeing is called a
  <strong>directive</strong>. Directives are prefixed with <code>v-</code> to indicate that they are special attributes
  provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is
  basically saying “keep this element’s <code>title</code> attribute up-to-date with the <code>message</code> property
  on the Vue instance.
