## Computed Properties and Watchers

In-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. For example:

```html
<div id="example">
  {{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}
</div>
```

At this point, the template is no longer simple and declarative. You have to look at it for a second before realizing that it displays message in reverse. The problem is made worse when you want to include the reversed message in your template more than once.

Thatâ€™s why for any complex logic, you should use a computed property.
