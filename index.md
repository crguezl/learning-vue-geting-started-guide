# My Notes to the  **Essentials** Section of the *Vue.js Guide*

<!--
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48429998/data-prefix-is-added-to-custom-attributes-how-to-prevent-this
-->
These are my notes written in pandoc markdown from reading the guide of Vue.js (v2) [@vuestart], the book [@djirdeh2018fullstack], [@awesomevue], [@vuejsfundamentals],
[@vuejscomponentsfundamentals]  and other [references](#references).

This document only covers
the initial sections, from section *Introduction* up to section *Computed Properties and Watchers*.

These notes have been ellaborated using pandoc.
At the current time (December 2021), this notes are experimental, since the HTML generated by pandoc has some incompatibilities with Vue and I had to resort to some awful tricks to made them work.


1. I'm using the [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) filter
1. The citation styles have been taken from [@citationstyles].

To see the result, you can 

1. Open the deployment in the  GitHub pages <https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/> of the repo containing the notes or
2. Run `npm start` to compile the sources and open the resulting `index.html` file

The [TOC](#toc) up there shows what I have already read.

!include introduction.md

!include the-vue-instance.md

!include template-syntax.md

!include computed-properties-and-watchers.md
