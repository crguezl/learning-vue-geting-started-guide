# My Notes to the Vue.js Guide

<!--
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48429998/data-prefix-is-added-to-custom-attributes-how-to-prevent-this
-->
This are my notes written in markdown from reading the guide of Vue.js (v2) [@vuestart], the book [@djirdeh2018fullstack] and other references.

These notes have been ellaborated using pandoc.
At the current time (December 2021), this notes are experimental, since the HTML generated by pandoc has some incompatibilities with Vue and I had to resort to some awful tricks to made them work.

To see the result, you can 

1. Open the deployment in the  GitHub pages <https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/> of the repo containing the notes or
2. Run `npm start`to compile the sources and open the resulting `index.html` file

!include introduction.md

!include the-vue-instance.md
